variable names - the components or other should start with a capital letter. The var name in line 1 'var CommentBox' can be created with lower case letter. But Reat framework understands it is a react based name and tried to convert it to an element when it encounters the variable as tag.

like this:
	<CommentBox />   --> 	React.createElement(CommentBox, null)

if a tag starts with a lower case letter, babel and react just outputs it as a tag and dont try to render it.

like: 
	<commentBox />    -->  <commentBox></commentBox>
